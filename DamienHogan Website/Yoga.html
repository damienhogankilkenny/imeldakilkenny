<h4>Yoga Workshop</h4>
<h5>Saturday, January 21st, from 2.00 - 4.30pm </h5>
<p>Explore the sacred practice of Ashtanga Yoga</p>
<p> "Introduction to Ashtanga Yoga" series, we touch on the philosophy of Ashtanga Yoga and guide you through the primary series. </p>

<p>We explore how the series is so intelligently designed to progressively strengthen and open up the body. Starting with the full primary series, we will recap on methods explored in Part 1. Over the course of the workshop, we will learn how to float forwards and backwards to create an amazing strength. This technique will bring your practice to another level.</p>

<p>We will focus on engaging bandhas (internal muscular locks) and building deep core strength to help you float lighter. To complete the session, we will move through some pranayama breathing techniques before ending with a Q + A session.</p>

<h4>Yoga</h4>
<p>By definition Yoga means union with life; it is a group of physical, mental and spiritual disciplines, originated in India. Through movement, meditation and breathing, Yoga brings a holistic approach to health, fitness and well-being. Yoga will tone the body, de-stress the mind and improve your overall quality of life. </p>

<h4>Vinyasa Yoga</h4>
<p>A fluid and moving practice that challenges in a way that also nurtures, grounds and builds the body’s strength and flexibility. Vinyasa style builds internal heat and really opens up the body. Creative sequencing encourages the body to burn toxins, strengthen and tone muscles and uplift the spirit. </p>

<h4>Slow Vinyasa Flow</h4>
<p> A Sunday well spent brings a week of content. Wind things down with this slow meditative 90 minute class. Dive deeper into your practice and set intentions for the week ahead.</p> 

<h4>Power Yoga</h4>
<p>A powerful and dynamic style of Yoga in which a set series of postures are linked dynamically to the breath in a flow of movement. Postures are held for longer and are designed to bring strength, flexibility, and endurance to the body. Each class ends with “Savasana”, known as corpse pose, deep relaxation to fully assimilate the benefits of Yoga practice.</p>

<h1>Slow Yoga Flow</h1>
<p>Flow and restore; this class allows your body to self-regulate and release layers of tension or any tightness you may have. Starting with a flow of Yoga poses, we then move into stillness with restorative yoga, using props to help the body relax and renew. Restorative Yoga is a powerful healing practice allowing us to harmonise the nervous system, which is our foundation. Classes will boost your mood and calm the mind while detoxifying the body. Excellent for sports people who wish to rejuvenate tired muscles. Flow Yoga is also fantastic for managing stress and anxiety.</p>

<h4>Yin Yoga</h4>
<p>Yin Yoga at its core is a magical celebration of your body and all its idiosyncrasies. It involves you adopting certain shapes and holding them for a considerable length of time, usually between 3 and 10 minutes. Through these long holds, you will ultimately learn how to sit with yourself in stillness. Anatomically, you will access tissue that your Yang Yoga practices don not enable you to target. Energetically, you will visit the meridian lines or nadis - the invisible energy lines that run through the body. </p>
<p>You will be challenged, and you will be uncomfortable, but that is the whole point. Every second that you remain in an uncomfortable situation you gain strength in dealing with discomfort. You will recognise the role that the mind plays in magnifying the experience and you will, with practice, become better able to minimise this role.  </p>

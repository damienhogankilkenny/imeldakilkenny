        <h1>Pilates For Life</h1>
        <p>Pilates is a method of body conditioning that will profoundly change the shape of your body. Building upon deep abdominal and back strength, Pilates safely and effectively delivers optimal strength, flexibility, endurance and posture without adding bulk or stress to the joints. Pilates focuses on restoring the natural curves to the spine while rebalancing the muscles around the joints.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Pull out your gym mat and get ready to do a series of movements that will stabilize and strengthen your core. The exercises are usually done in a specific order, one right after another. The movements have names, like The 100, Criss-Cross, Mermaid and Swan.</p>
<p>The moves may look simple, but they take a lot of precision and control. It is not like doing a bunch of crunches; there is a strong emphasis on technique. You can do Pilates on an exercise mat, either in a class or at home, using a DVD. Or you can go to a gym or studio that has special equipment, a class, or a trainer who can supervise you.</p>
<p>Pilates classes typically take 45 minutes to an hour, but you can do fewer moves in less time. You will get stronger, more sculpted muscles and gain flexibility. You may also have better posture and a better sense of well-being.</p>
<p>Plan on doing this workout a few days a week, in addition to cardio, since Pilates is not aerobic.</p>
<h4>Intensity Level</h4>
<p>Medium It is demanding, but it is not the kind of workout that always works up a sweat. It is all about concentration and breathing. But you’ll definitely feel it in your muscles during each exercise.</p>
<h4>Areas It Targets</h4>
<p>Pilates main focus is on core however, you can expect to see strength gains in your arms and legs.  Positions and movements used to activate core rely on extremities to control &/or apply loads to the core and likewise will benefit from Pilates.</p>      
      
<h2>what you can expect from this workout</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility: Yes. The exercises in a Pilates workout will boost your flexibility and joint mobility.</li>

<li>Aerobic: No. This is not a cardio workout.</li>

<li>Strength: Yes. This workout will make your muscles stronger. You’ll use your own body weight instead of weights.</li>

<li>Sport: No.</li>

<li>Low-Impact: Yes. You will engage your muscles in a strong but gentle way.</li>
<li>Good for beginners? Yes. You can start with basic exercises then try advanced moves as you get better. If you are starting out, opt for a class or private lessons so an instructor can keep an eye on your form to help prevent an injury.</li>
<li>Outdoors: No. Expect to go to the gym or be in a room with a TV for this workout.</li>

<li>At home: Yes. Pull out your mat and press play on your smart phone for a convenient at-home workout.</li>

<li>Equipment required? Yes, you’ll need a mat. Some gyms have special machines for Pilates, called a Reformer. You can get a modified version for your home, but you probably don’t need it.</li>
</ul>
